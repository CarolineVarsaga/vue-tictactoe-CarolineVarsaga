## ABOUT THIS PROJECT 
In this assignment, my task was to build a tic tac toe-game in one week. The focus was on Vue - states, props and emits. The following requirements were to be included: 

- Be able to enter player names for X and O
- Be able to play a game and determine a winner or a draw
- Prevent making additional moves after the game is over
- Be able to start a new game
- Use at least one component

For even better grade: 

- Use at least three components for your solution
- Save score history for the players
- Be able to display score statistics
- Be able to close the browser and return to where the game left off
- Be able to reset statistics and start over with new players

## ABOUT THE PROCESS AND THOUGHTS
I started with a pen and paper and skissed up the logic. After that I started with the landing page and worked it one step at a time, deeper into the logic. 


If I would do this again, I would try to use even more components. Break it down even more. Now pretty much code ended up in the same component. 
I believe I would have created a separate SCSS-file too. 

It has been a fun project. I will practice more Vue in the future. 


_Learning **is** doing!_ :)
